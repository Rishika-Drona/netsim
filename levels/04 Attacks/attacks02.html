<p>In this level, Alice's Internet browsing is being <strong>censored.</strong> She can browse an <strong>allowed site</strong>, but the censor will drop any packets to a <strong>blocked site</strong>.

<p>One way to evade censorship is to make an intermediate connection to a <strong>proxy server</strong>. This server will take packets that are destined to it and redirect them to the blocked site. Since the censor can only see the link between Alice and the proxy, it does not know which site Alice is browsing through it.

<p>To beat this level, you need to evade the censor and send a packet from Alice to the Blocked Site.</p>
