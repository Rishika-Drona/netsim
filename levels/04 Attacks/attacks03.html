<p>In this level, the routers use the <strong>time to live (TTL)</strong> field.  The TTL field is designed to keep packets from getting trapped in infinite loops: each router decreases the TTL value by one, and if it ever reaches zero, it stops forwarding the packet and returns an error message instead.<p>

<p>We have hidden the IP addresses of the routers in this level.  Your job is to figure out who they are!</p>

<p><i><strong>Fun fact:</strong> This trick is called "tracerouting", and you can do it for real to see the routers between you and anyone else. Ask a TA to show you how!</i></p>

<h3>Level Objectives</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Figure out how to use TTLs to figure out the IP addresses of routers</li>
	<li>Send a ping to <strong>each</strong> of the four routers between Alice and Google</li>
</ul>
