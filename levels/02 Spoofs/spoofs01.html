<p>The srcip and dstip headers can be easily changed to specify different source and destination addresses.
In the previous levels, we saw that changing the destination address changed the direction in which the packet was sent.
Note, however, that we did not need to specify a source address. In fact, routers do not take into account where
a packet is coming from, only where it is going. One security flaw of the Internet is that we can easily make a
packet <strong>look</strong> like it is coming from one address when it is really coming from another. This is called
<strong>spoofing</strong>.

<p>To pass this level, send a packet from Alice's computer to Bob's computer that looks like it is coming from Carol.

<p><em>Notice that we can trick Bob into thinking Carol is talking to him, even though we're not allowed to send packets from Carol!</em>
