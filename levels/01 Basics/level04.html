<p>Computers are usually not connected directly, but are accessible through a series of <strong>routers</strong>.
A router operates much like a postal office. When it receives a <strong>packet</strong>, it looks at the destination
and determines which route to send it on. They usually choose the route that is closest to the destination
computer. They keep track of all their routes in a <strong>routing table</strong>.
<p>Pause the simulation and look at one of the packets. It contains only the srcip and dstip headers we saw in the
earlier levels. There is no extra information to tell the routers how to send the packet. Instead, this information
is stored in the router's routing table.
<p>To pass this level, send a packet from Bob's computer to Carol's computer.
