<p> Often, your personal computer is connected to the Internet
 through a <strong>modem</strong>. This <strong>modem</strong> takes the outgoing packets from all the machines connected to it
 and set the source address to a single value (such as "Home"). Incoming packets are then mapped back to the original
 machines. Pause the simulation and look at the packet information before and after it passes through the 
 <strong>modem</strong>.
 
 <p>To pass this level, send a <strong>ping</strong> request from Alice's computer to Google.
 
 <p><em><strong>Remember:</strong> ping packets have a transport layer header called <span class="ul">proto</span> with the value <span class="ul">ICMP</span></em></p>
