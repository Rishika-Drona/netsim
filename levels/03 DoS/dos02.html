<p>A server or computer can protect itself by blocking malicious computers using a <strong>firewall</strong>. A
<strong>firewall</strong> keeps a list of "bad" source addresses and drops all packets that come from an address on
the list. In this example, Google has learned from the previous attack that Alice is a malicious user and has set up
a firewall to block her. Observe how the packets from Alice's computer to Google are dropped.

<p>One way for an adversary to bypass a <strong>firewall</strong> is to launch a <strong>Distributed Denial of
Service (DDos)</strong> attack. To do this, the adversary sends packets from multiple machines under her control.
<p>To pass this level, launch a <strong>DDoS</strong> attack against Google from Alice's additional machines.

<h3>Level Objectives</h3>

<ul><li>send Google more packets than it can handle</li></ul>
