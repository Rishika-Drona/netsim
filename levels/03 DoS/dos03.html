<p>The router in this level responds to a special type of ping, called a "Broadcast ping".  When a router receives a packet that is addressed
to the broadcast address, it replicates it and sends it to <em>all</em> the machines on the network.

<p>In this level, Google has received an <strong>upgrade</strong>: it can no longer be DoS'd from a single computer.  
Multiple computers will be required to coordinate with each other in order to send enough traffic.

<p>However, you only have control of a single computer!  You will have to implement a <strong>smurf attack</strong>.  In a smurf attack, you leverage 
other devices to send traffic <em>for you</em>.

<p>Experiment with sending broadcast pings by sending a message with the dstip set to "Broadcast".  
See if you can overwhelm Google by combining this with what you learned about spoofing packet source addresses.
