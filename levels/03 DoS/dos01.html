<p>A <strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong> attack overwhelms a computer or server by flooding it with <strong>packets</strong>.
The purpose of <strong>DoS</strong> attacks are to make a system (such as Google) unavailable for others to use.
This often distracts the administrators of the system and allows an attacker to exploit it in different ways and
remain unnoticed.

<p>In this level, you will execute a <strong>DoS</strong> attack against Google. To pass the level, you must overwhelm the server
by sending it many packets. Experiment with the amount of packets to see how many the website can handle. 

<p><em><strong>Hint:</strong> remember that you can easily send duplicate packets using the "Repeat" feature of the Editor</em> 
<h3>Level Objectives</h3>

<ul><li>send Google more packets than it can handle</li></ul>
